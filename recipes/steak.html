        <h4>Salisbury steak with a savory onion sauce.</h4> 
        <p>This yummy recipe has been in my family for years. 
           It's easy to cook but tastes like it <br>took hours to make!
           I usually make enough extra sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients::</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Beef: This Salisbury steak recipe starts with 1.5 pounds of ground beef. </li>
            <li> Canned soup: A can of condensed French onion soup adds moisture, richness, and flavor to the patties. It also serves as the base for the gravy. </li>
            <li> Bread crumbs: Bread crumbs give the patties structure.</li>
            <li> Egg: An egg helps hold the patties together.</li>
            <li> Seasonings: These easy Salisbury steaks are simply seasoned with salt and black pepper. Mustard powder enhances the flavor of the gravy.</li>
            <li>Flour: All-purpose flour thickens the gravy.</li>
            <li>Sauces: You'll need ketchup and Worcestershire sauce.</li>    
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Make and shape the patties.</li>
            <li>Brown the patties on both sides, then drain the excess fat.</li>
            <li>Make and season the gravy.</li>
            <li>Pour the gravy over the patties and continue cooking until the meat is cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
